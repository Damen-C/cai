							Greetings! My name is Danmeng Cai, and I am currently pursuing a <a href="https://informatics.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/">Master of Science degree in Informatics</a> at the <a href="https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/">University of Tsukuba</a>.
							I specialize in Natural Language Processing and conduct my research at the <a href="https://tzkwkblab.github.io/wkblab/">Machine Learning & Language Understanding Lab</a>.
							My academic interests also extend to other fields in machine learning, particularly exploring cutting-edge developments in the field.
							I am passionate about exploring the potential of AI to contribute to sustainable development across a range of areas, including business, education, and the environment.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							I earned a Bachelor's degree in International Relations and a Master's degree in International Area Studies.
							I participated in the Health Economics track of the International Summer School organized by <a href="https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html">Hamburg University</a> in July 2019.
							It was there that I was first exposed to the applications of machine learning in healthcare systems.
							Later that same year, I had the opportunity to study abroad at <a href="https://wustl.edu/">Washington University in St. Louis</a>,
							which further fueled my passion for programming and data analysis.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							Beyond academia, I have gained valuable work experience as a full-time social media account manager at a cosmetics and supplement manufacturer in the Chugoku area of Japan.
							In this role, I was responsible for planning and executing campaign activities on various social media platforms such as Weibo, WeChat, Redbook, and Douyin.
							In addition to this, I have also worked part-time as a tutor, translator, and data analyst.
							With fluency in Chinese, Japanese, and English at a business level,
							I am able to effectively communicate and collaborate with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
						</p>
						<p style="text-align: left;">
							In my free time, I enjoy writing articles about NLP and machine learning on <a href="https://medium.com/@cd_24">Medium</a>.
							Feel free to check out my profile, and I'm sure you'll find something new and interesting to learn!
